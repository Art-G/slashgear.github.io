{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>One thing to start with, I'm not an Internet warrior. I do not wish to make Dev.to's judgment here and try to convince you that this platform is right or wrong.</p>\n<p>Instead, I would like to alert people to a trend that is endangering the web as we know it.</p>\n<h1>TL;DR</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I don't think Dev.to is a problem but how authors use it. Authors should not post their content only on dev.to.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>\"But in fact, what's your problem with Dev.to ?\"</h2>\n<p>Being an author for several years. I have long shared articles on my personal blog. I was quickly confronted with an obvious problem. It is difficult to \"make\" a small personal blog live in a web world where social networks are taking up more and more space.</p>\n<p>By publishing on my personal blog, I had a small audience. It was difficult for my articles to persecute the bubble of my first level contacts.</p>\n<p>I was therefore quickly tempted to find a solution to remedy this visibility problem. The solution presented by one of my colleagues seemed attractive to me.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Why don't you try the new Medium platform? Authors who publish on Medium have thousands of readers and in addition the editing interface is cool!\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That's what I did. I regret it today. I stopped publishing on my personal blog and started writing and publishing my posts on Medium only.</p>\n<p><strong>And then unfortunately the story went wrong!</strong></p>\n<p>Medium, in only a few months, and following some business decisions, has really become a platform to avoid.</p>\n<p>User tracking, advertising, a paywall, a real disgusting cocktail to make <a href=\"https://www.laquadrature.net/en/\">\"la quadrature du net\"</a> scream. Many people have decided to abandon the platform as a result of these decisions. </p>\n<p>I'm not saying Dev.to will suffer the same fate. I'm not a medium, I don't have the ability to see into the future. But theoretically, Dev.to remains a company with financial needs. The stability of Dev.to's <em>Business Model</em> is rather obscure.</p>\n<p>You really have to trust the team so that Dev.to doesn't go in the wrong direction. I would very much like to hear Ben Halpern's opinion on this subject.</p>\n<h1>So we should stop writing on Dev.to ?</h1>\n<p><strong>The answer is NO</strong></p>\n<p>Dev.to is great, and have an amazing community. <strong>But</strong>, authors should not post their blog content only on Dev.to.</p>\n<p>We should follow the <strong>P.O.S.S.E</strong> principle.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is necessary to be responsible for the publication of its content on the Internet. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>To protect the web from hyper-centralization</li>\n<li>To promote your blog</li>\n<li>To avoid having your copyrights stolen</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All authors should have their own personal blog where they publish the content. They can then share it on other platforms by indicating a <code>canonical url</code> pointing to their blog page.</p>\n<p>Dev.to has this feature, which is very rare. <strong>I would really like this feature to be highlighted</strong> so that the authors are aware of the problem.</p>\n<p>For example, this post is available on my personal blog and this content is shared here on Dev.to. </p>\n<p>I also worked on a project a side project for an open source syndication platform named <a href=\"https://open-blog.dev/\">\"Open Blog\"</a> in order to raise awareness about not being the owner of your content. If you liked this article, don't hesitate to take a look at it.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Why you should not publish content on Dev.to ?"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/posts/stop-dev-to/"}}
