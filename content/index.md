# Antoine Caron
24 years old, Full-Stack Developer, working with AngularJS, React, Spring Boot,
MongoDB,...

Burgundian by birth, adoption Lyonnais, high school diploma in pockets
I went to [Polytech Lyon](http://polytech.univ-lyon1.fr/) to start my studies to become a computer
science engineer.

Fascinated by new technologies, I have learned during my internships or
personal experiences in many areas.

I was able to work alone or in teams for several years.This site lists
many of the IT skills acquired Polytech but some have not been presented
here.

I am currently working for [Zenika](http://zenika.com/) as Web Developer.

On this blog you will see articles in French and in English about technologies I use and appreciate.
I may share my experience as a teacher in the university of Lyon.
